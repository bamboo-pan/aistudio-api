## Scenario: Gateway Replay Uses Captured Request Contract

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: Browser-backed capture/replay code crosses capture service, replay service, streaming gateway, and browser session boundaries.
- Use this contract whenever replaying an AI Studio `GenerateContent` request captured from the browser.

### 2. Signatures

- `CapturedRequest.url: str`
- `CapturedRequest.headers: dict[str, str]`
- `CapturedRequest.body: str`
- `CapturedRequest.replay_headers: dict[str, str]`
- `BrowserSession.send_hooked_request(*, body: str, url: str, headers: dict[str, str], timeout_ms: int)`
- `BrowserSession.send_streaming_request(*, body: str, url: str, headers: dict[str, str], timeout_ms: int)`

### 3. Contracts

- Capture is responsible for returning a complete `CapturedRequest` containing the replay URL, original headers, and template body.
- Replay and streaming must pass `captured.url` and `captured.replay_headers` into `BrowserSession`; they must not ask the session to rediscover URL/header state from private template caches.
- `CapturedRequest.replay_headers` must exclude hop/body-length headers that browser XHR should not set manually: `host` and `content-length`.
- Pure HTTP replay may still use `captured.url` directly with an HTTP client and the same sanitized headers.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- `captured is None` -> replay returns `(0, b"")` or streaming raises a clear captured-request error.
- Missing/invalid auth after replay reaches AI Studio -> propagate upstream authentication/authorization status.
- Empty session template cache with valid `CapturedRequest` -> replay must still send the browser XHR using captured URL/headers.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: A cached snapshot returns `CapturedRequest`; replay uses `captured.url` and succeeds without reading `BrowserSession._templates`.
- Base: A fresh capture returns `CapturedRequest`; replay and streaming both use the same captured URL/header contract.
- Bad: Account switching clears `BrowserSession._templates`, capture reuses a service-level cached template, and replay fails locally with `no captured URL available for replay`.

### 6. Tests Required

- Unit: non-streaming replay with a fake browser session that has no template cache; assert URL, sanitized headers, body, and timeout passed to `send_hooked_request`.
- Unit: streaming replay with a fake browser session that has no template cache; assert URL and sanitized headers passed to `send_streaming_request`.
- Integration/real: browser-backed `/v1/chat/completions` request returns an upstream result or upstream auth error, not local `no captured URL available for replay`.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```python
return await self._session.send_hooked_request(body=body, timeout_ms=timeout * 1000)
```

#### Correct

```python
return await self._session.send_hooked_request(
	body=body,
	url=captured.url,
	headers=captured.replay_headers,
	timeout_ms=timeout * 1000,
)
```

##### Correct request-level image timeout override

```python
image_kwargs = {"prompt": prompt, "model": model}
if req.timeout is not None:
	image_kwargs["timeout"] = req.timeout
output = await client.generate_image(**image_kwargs)
```

```javascript
const timeout = this.normalizeImageTimeout()
const body = { model: this.imageModel, prompt, size: this.imageSize }
if (timeout) body.timeout = timeout
```
